# Defining & Tracking Bias in Wikipedia Edits  

## **Defining Bias in Wikipedia Edits**  
Bias can manifest in multiple ways, including:  
1. **Word Choice & Framing Bias** – Changing language to subtly alter the tone (e.g., "uprising" vs. "terrorist attack").  
2. **Source Bias** – Replacing a neutral source with a partisan one or removing balanced citations.  
3. **Selective Omission or Inclusion** – Adding/removing key facts to push a particular narrative.  
4. **Coordinated Editing Patterns** – Groups of editors working together to reinforce a viewpoint across multiple pages.  
5. **Volume of Edits by a Single Editor or Group** – A small number of editors dominating a page’s changes.  
6. **Reversion & Dispute History** – High levels of edit reversions signaling ideological battles.

## **Tracking & Identifying Bias**  
To detect and classify bias, we discussed several approaches:  

### **1. NLP for Sentiment & Framing Detection**  
- Sentiment analysis to track if edits introduce more positive or negative tones.  
- Stance detection to classify changes as aligning with known ideological positions.  

### **2. Comparison Against Baseline Data**  
- Comparing edits to past versions of the same Wikipedia page to detect shifts.  
- Cross-referencing Wikipedia content with reputable third-party sources to highlight discrepancies.  

### **3. Editor Behavior & Network Analysis**  
- Tracking editors with a pattern of ideological edits across multiple pages.  
- Detecting groups of editors who consistently approve or revert each other’s changes.  

### **4. Fact-Checking & Misinformation Detection**  
- Using AI to flag factual inconsistencies between Wikipedia edits and established records.  
- Identifying citations from known biased or unreliable sources.  

### **5. Reversion & Edit War Analysis**  
- Monitoring pages with frequent reverts, which may indicate ideological disputes.  
- Analyzing which editors are reverting whom and whether one side is dominating.

## **How This Will Inform the User Experience**  
These bias-tracking methods will help surface:  
- **Bias Scores & Leaning Indicators** – Showing whether a page has shifted toward one perspective.  
- **Flagged Edits & Controversial Changes** – Highlighting specific edits that alter neutrality.  
- **Editor Influence & Bias Patterns** – Displaying whether a small group controls the page.  
- **Fact-Check Warnings** – Notifying users if changes contradict widely accepted facts.
